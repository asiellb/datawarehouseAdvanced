# Series Summary by Author

Please write a few sentence to sum up your series (this can be an *updated* version of the summary provided in your original proposal). This is used to write web copy for your series. Additionally, please write the prerquisites for the whole series here as well. This list will also be used to write web copy for your series. Here is an example:

EXAMPLE:
Bayesian-based probability and time series methods allow data scientists to adapt their models to uncertainty and better predict outcomes. In this series of liveProjects, you’ll take on the role of a data scientist making customer predictions for hotels and airlines. You’ll use ARIMA, Bayesian dynamic linear modeling, PyMC3 and TensorFlow Probability to model hotel booking cancelations, and implement a Prophet model with uncertainty analysis to forecast air passenger numbers. Each project in the series is focused on a different time series forecasting model, allowing you to compare model performance and choose the skills most relevant to your career development.

These liveProjects are for data analysts who have an intermediate level of knowledge with data science-based Python tools as well as an intermediate knowledge of time series analysis. To begin these liveProjects, you will need to be familiar with:

TOOLS
Intermediate knowledge of Python, particularly the pandas, NumPy, and scikit-klearn libraries
Basic knowledge of TensorFlow

TECHNIQUES
Intermediate understanding of time series forecasting
Intermediate understanding of time series analysis
Intermediate understanding of statistics and probability methods
