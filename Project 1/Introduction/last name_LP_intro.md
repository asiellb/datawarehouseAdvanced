# about this liveProject
[SCENARIO]
You are a Data Engineer building an End-to-End project connecting various data sources with your new datawarehouse in **BigQuery**.

Your data stack is modern, cost effective, flexible (you can connect any data source you want) and can scale easily to meet growing data resources you have. Your company is a mobile game development studio and have various products being sold on both platforms, IOS and ANDROID. Your development stack is also hybrid and includes AWS and GCP. 

All data files come from varioius data surces, i.e. databases, kinesis firehose streams and various notification services in different formats (CSV, JSON, PARQUET, etc.).
As a data engineer you were tasked to create a new data pipeline to feed financial data from **PayPal** into the datawarehouse. This should help Finance team to create a revenue reconciliation report in Data Studio and run it daily. 

You decide to use **AWS Lambda functions** and **Node.js** for this task as the rest of your team have been using this tech for many other microservices they deploy.
