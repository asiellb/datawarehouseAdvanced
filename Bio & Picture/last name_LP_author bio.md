# Author Bio

Here are guidelines to following when writing your bio: 
* Bios should be around 50-100 words


* Written in the third person (i.e. “Venkatesh Patel is a machine learning engineer at Google. He has previously worked as…” rather than “I am a machine learning engineer at Google.”)

    * Focused on professional achievements, such as:
    * Current job role
    * Former notable job roles
    * Experience in the liveProject topic area
    * Open source tools and other projects you have contributed to
    * Postgraduate academic qualifications
    * Speaking engagements and conference appearances
    * MVP status and other professional recognitions
    * Books, courses, and other formal publications you have developed
    * Blogging and web-based writing


* Avoid personal details (Things like “He loves his dog Max, and enjoys water skiing in his spare time” are not appropriate.)
