## Project conclusions

The traditional ETL, which stands for Extraction, Transformation, and Loading, has now evolved onto ELT. Data is Extracted from source systems, Loaded into the data warehouse and then Transformed within the data warehouse. This live project helps you manage that "E" part, the extraction from external data sources.

* Whether youâ€™re a startup or a global enterprise, you've learned how to use **serverless** to extract data from 3rd party data sources.

* You've learned the concepts of datalake, datawarehouse and decoupled data storage,

* You've learned how to use AWS Lambda functions to create a simple and reliable data extraction pipeline.

All these above provide an idea or a template which could be easile extended and replicated for any other external data source you might require in the future.
